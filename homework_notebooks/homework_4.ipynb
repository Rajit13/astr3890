    "This question is about IQ. It's a flawed and questionable metric, but useful for this problem. By definition, IQ is calibrated as a Gaussian distribution with $\\mu=100$ and $\\sigma=15$. \n",
    "\n",
    "1) Create a `scipy.stats` Gaussian object with the given $\\mu$ and $\\sigma$. a) Plot the distribution, b) give 10 random draws, along with the pdf at each of the draws. \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Access the `cdf` property of the Gaussian object and plot it over the same $x$-range as in (1) but in a different figure. Access the `ppf` property (percent point function) and use *inverse transform sampling* of the cdf to draw $10^4$ random samples, and make a histogram of these. Overplot the pdf from (1). These should match.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What fraction of people have IQ > 130? *Hint: investigate all the properties of the Gaussian object from (1) to find the relevant property that gives you this, or perform a calculation involving the cdf.*\n",
